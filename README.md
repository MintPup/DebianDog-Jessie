A fork of [DebianDog](https://github.com/DebianDog/Jessie)

I will continue the development of [DebianDog-Jessie-jwm_icewm-2015-09-02.iso](https://github.com/DebianDog/Jessie/releases/tag/v.1.0) version here. Forking the repository with git makes it over 700Mb because of included inside packages. Even deleting the newer branch and the package repositories keeps 180Mb useless space. I will start fresh keeping only scripts and information inside. All other files will be uploaded as releases.

This version will be developed for my own needs only. If you still can find here something useful I'm glad.
But if you like to change it or develop it in different direction, please - make your own fork.

DebianDog is very small 32-bit Debian Live CD shaped to look and act like Puppy Linux. Debian structure and Debian behaviour are untouched and Debian documentation is 100% valid for DebianDog. You have access to all debian repositories using apt-get or synaptic.
